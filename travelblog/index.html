      <h3>Overview:</h3>
      
      <div class="body_p">
        This past summer I went down to San Diego for a six week discipleship training program with my church, Resonate. Throughout the program we learned a lot on how to be a follower of Jesus, server others, and develop as leaders. It was a transformational summer for myself and many others that went on the trip.

        It was quite exciting to be a part of a group where we all believed the same core foundational truths:
      </div> 

      <div class="specialized">
         That the God of the universe created the world and everything in it. However, through our own decision, we have rejected God as who he truly is and have taken ownership of our own lives. This decision that Adam & Eve made when they were in the Garden of Eden is replicated continuously as we chose to be our own gods rather than submitting to the true God of the universe – this created a gap between God and us that we could never bridge. But God himself in the flesh, Jesus the Christ, came down and was born into this world and lived a perfect life, that no one ever could, suffered, and died on a Roman torture device to bear the sins of the world. He did not stay dead, he rose three days later, victorious over sin and death. This is what God offers to us, that if allow Jesus to be Lord over our lives and we believe that Jesus died and rose again, we shall too live with Jesus in his victory over sin and death.

        <br>
        Through this understanding of who we are, who God is, and the purpose we have in the world – we were communally trying to learn what it means to follow Jesus with this understanding. 
        <br><br>
        In conjunction to learning together, we also had a blast together doing things in Southern California – surfing, eating at great restaurants, going on adventures, etc.

        Thank you for reading and hearing about my summer!

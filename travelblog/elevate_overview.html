      <h3>Elevate:</h3>
      
      <div class="body_p">
        Elevate is a 5 week spiritual leadership project located in San Diego, CA connected to Resonate Church. Since 2013, we have provided an opportunity for students to learn biblical truths and practical skills in the context of Christian community. Our aim is to build a foundation of faith and leadership skills in each student’s life that equips them to be a lifelong kingdom leader.

      <h3>Why San Diego?</h3>

     <div class="body_p">
        At first glance, spending 5 weeks in San Diego may seem like a vacation instead of a mission trip or leadership project.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, an organization we partner with - The North American Mission Board - has named San Diego one of it’s most strategic cities. Though it may seem like a glamorous place to spend the summer, San Diego is one of the most unreached cities when it comes to the Gospel. 
        <br><br>
        There are roughly 3.1 million people living in San Diego, with only 9.8 percent of them claiming to be followers of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        The goal of a traditional mission trip is to meet tangible needs in hopes of creating a pathway to share the Gospel. The needs of the average person in San Diego mirror the needs of those on a college campus: the need to be known in relationships that go beyond surface level. In American culture, this is often the key access point to communicate the love of Jesus through the Gospel.
